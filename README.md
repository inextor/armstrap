Overview
This custom CSS grid system is inspired by Bootstrap's grid system but offers unique advantages and flexibility. It provides a robust framework for creating responsive layouts with ease. The system includes a base .c-row class for rows and various column classes (e.g., .col-1, .col-2, ..., .col-12) for defining column widths. Additionally, it supports responsive breakpoints for different container sizes, ensuring layouts adapt seamlessly across devices.
Key Features
1. Base Row and Column Classes
.c-row: Defines a row container with flexible wrapping and gutter spacing.
container-type: inline-size;: Ensures the container adapts to its content size.
--bs-gutter-x: 1.5rem;: Horizontal gutter spacing between columns.
--bs-gutter-y: 0;: Vertical gutter spacing between rows (default is 0).
display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;: Enables flexible layout with wrapping.
margin-top, margin-right, margin-left: Negative margins to counteract gutter spacing.
Base Columns ([class*="col-"]): Base styles for all columns.
box-sizing: border-box;: Ensures padding and borders are included in the total width.
flex: 0 0 auto;: Columns have fixed widths.
flex-grow: 0; flex-shrink: 0;: Prevents columns from growing or shrinking.
2. Individual Column Widths
Columns are defined with specific widths ranging from .col-1 (8.333333%) to .col-12 (100%). Each column class sets the width using the !important rule to ensure it takes precedence over other styles.
3. Responsive Breakpoints
The system supports multiple breakpoints for different container sizes:
Small containers (sm): min-width: 576px
Medium containers (md): min-width: 768px
Large containers (lg): min-width: 992px
Extra large containers (xl): min-width: 1200px
Extra extra large containers (xxl): min-width: 1400px
Each breakpoint includes column classes (e.g., .col-sm-1, .col-md-1, etc.) that override the base column widths, allowing for responsive layouts.
Advantages Over Bootstrap's Grid System
1. Customizability
Inline Size Container: The container-type: inline-size; property allows for more flexible container sizing compared to Bootstrap's fixed-width containers.
Custom Gutter Variables: The use of CSS variables (--bs-gutter-x, --bs-gutter-y) makes it easy to adjust gutter spacing without modifying the core CSS.
2. Performance
Reduced Overhead: This system is designed to be lightweight, reducing the overall CSS footprint compared to Bootstrap's more extensive grid system.
Efficient Flexbox Usage: The use of flex: 0 0 auto; ensures columns have fixed widths, which can improve layout performance.
3. Ease of Use
Simplified Syntax: The class naming convention is straightforward and consistent, making it easy to understand and implement.
Responsive Breakpoints: The use of @container queries for breakpoints ensures that layouts adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes without additional media queries.
4. Flexibility
Dynamic Column Widths: The ability to define custom column widths using CSS variables allows for more dynamic and flexible layouts.
Nested Grids: The system supports nested grids, enabling complex layouts with ease.
5. Modern CSS Features
CSS Variables: The use of CSS variables for gutter spacing and other properties provides a more modern and maintainable approach.
Container Queries: The use of @container queries ensures that the grid system is future-proof and leverages the latest CSS features.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Row and Column Layout

```
<div class="c-row">
  <div class="col-6">Column 1</div>
  <div class="col-6">Column 2</div>
</div>
```
### Responsive Layout

```
<div class="c-row">
  <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3">Column 1</div>
  <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3">Column 2</div>
  <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3">Column 3</div>
  <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3">Column 4</div>
</div>
```

### Custom Gutter Spacing

```
<div class="c-row" style="--bs-gutter-x: 2rem;">
  <div class="col-6">Column 1</div>
  <div class="col-6">Column 2</div>
</div>
```
